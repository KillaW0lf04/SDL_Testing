SDL Testing
-----------

My first attempt at game programming using the cross platform SDL Library. Given enough time i'll hopefully
be able to extend this to some form of 3D N-Body simulation in combination with OpenCL for fast performance.

NOTE: This uses an out of date version of SDL (1.2)

I have a seperate repository for testing development with SDL 2.0 [here](https://github.com/KillaW0lf04/SDL2_Testing)
